# Performance-Measurement
Measured performance of CPU and memory resources identifying specific locations where performance bottlenecks exist using Valgrind. Developed programs that measures performance and execution time in C. Utilized Valgrind to convert program running on simulated CPU to measure performance and detect memory leaks.
